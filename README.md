# Intro-R

This is my R introduction lesson from dtsense course. I am using google colab so I hope that other learners can use it easily without installing R software (you can create new notebook by accessing this link https://colab.research.google.com/#create=true&language=r). For more detail you can check their youtube on https://www.youtube.com/c/DTSense/videos
